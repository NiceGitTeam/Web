				<h2>How much time does your team <strong>waste on handoffs?</strong></h2>
				<p>When designers, writers, product managers and other team members can't interact directly with their project, developers become bottlenecks. 
				   NiceGit eliminates handoffs by giving everyone appropriate tools to work together on their repository.</p>
				<p>Copy changes are made by your writers and product managers. Image changes by your designers and artists.</p>
				<p>Your developers can keep using the Git tools they love while the rest of your team gets an intuitive interface to the same project files.</p>

				   With NiceGit, team members can focus on their specializations while still participating in your Git workflow.</p>
				<p>Real-time visibility shows who's working on what, with file locking preventing conflicts before they happen and enabling true cross-disciplinary collaboration.</p>
