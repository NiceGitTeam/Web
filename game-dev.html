				<h2>End the <strong>asset management nightmare</strong></h2>
				<p>Game development creates massive repositories with large binary files, complex dependencies, and multiple contributors. 
				   Traditional Git tools weren't designed for this level of complexity or the types of files you work with.</p>
				<p>NiceGit gives you clear visual previews of asset changes, real-time collaboration awareness, and intuitive conflict resolution tailored for game development workflows.</p>

				<h2><strong>Empower your whole team</strong></h2>
				<p>Your artists and designers shouldn't need to learn complex Git commands or live in fear of breaking the build.</p>
				<p>With NiceGit, everyone on your team gets a workflow tailored to their role. Artists can manage their own assets, designers can tweak level files, and programmers can focus on code - all working in parallel without stepping on each other's toes.</p>
