<blockquote>I want to tell everyone: 'Hey Vibe Coders, this is going to be hard and painful...'</blockquote>

I wouldn't normally post third-party content on the blog. But this episode of [The Standup podcast](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL2Fq-K0QdOQiJpufsnhEd1z3xOv2JMHuk) is 80 minutes of discussion of exactly the problems that NiceGit is solving. While the tone is light and playful, the panel makes some really insightful observations, particularly on what their idealised source control system would look like. (Spoiler: It sounds _very_ familiar!)

Many thanks to the always interesting [Daryl Anthony](https://www.linkedin.com/in/darylantony/) of [Yes Human](https://yeshuman.io) for sending this my way.

## Selected highlights

### 25-30m: Some cool ideas around 'Quantum Branching' and 'File Superposition'. 

NiceGit doesn't do this but the motivation to be able to see multiple users' changes simultaneously on the file system is an interesting one. Followed later by everyone laughing about the ridiculousness of needing to use quantum physics analogies to _simplify_ traditional source control! 

### 40m: The differences between coding and non-coding workflows

<blockquote>I don't think Git matches how art changes. Just to be clear I think that Git is a very code oriented source control" </blockquote>


### 32m: The luck of the merge

<blockquote>You're forcing one person to merge based on who happened to hit the push first!</blockquote>

### 48m: A better future

<blockquote>I don't have any specific distaste for Git, it's that I don't like version control in general. I think it is too ownorous and puts too much emphasis on itself. I just want like I want a modern versioned file system thing that's way less in your face, way less something that I have to think about, and is only there when something goes really wrong.</blockquote>
