To support our early Design Partners NiceGit now works with Self-Managed GitLab.

Most teams choose to their projects on one of the major cloud hosting providers, such as [GitLab](https://gitlab.com), [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org) and [GitHub](https://gitlab.com), all of which are supported by NiceGit. Organisations with particular requirements, such as security or data jurisdiction, may choose to host their data on their own servers, using a tool such as [Self-Managed GitLab](https://docs.gitlab.com/topics/offline/quick_start_guide/).

Integrating NiceGit's unique full-stack approach to source control required some upgrades to our back-end systems, and especially to authentication. There were a couple of technical challenges to overcome, and the good news is that not only is the feature fully working, the back-end improvements benefit all users. A better, faster sign in experience being just the start. Special thank you to GitLab for providing an Enterprise License to assist development.

If you have any particular requirements that might help with your access to the [NiceGit Beta](/beta), please do [let us know](/contact) and we'll do our best to accommodate them!
