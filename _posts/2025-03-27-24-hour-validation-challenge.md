## The Challenge

[Ajay Prakash](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ajayvprakash/) has challenged Startmate LaunchClub founders to validate their startup idea within the next 24 hours. It's a bit of a Hail Mary, but exactly what I need to get out of my comfort zone with NiceGit.

I'll be posting progress updates to this page over the next 24h and then any results, starting with my first AI driven cold outreach effort using Apollo.io...

## _26 March 2025, 8pm_ The world's roughest cold outreach campaign

Last night (26/3) I had an hour (while also making a Toad in the Hole for dinner) to setup up the cold outreach campaign. Sign up and basic setup was easy enough, the main steps:

- Give Apollo full access to a Gmail account (had to take off my security officer hat for this one!)

- Create a 'Sequence' of emails for cold outreach. I used Apollo's AI to generate a draft sequence of three emails. A nice feature is you can just enter your product's website (e.g. https://nicegit.com) and it will scan most of the relevant info it needs. The generated emails were surprisingly bare, around 5-10 sentences of pure text. It was recommended not to include images, which was an interesting learning.

- Create a 'List' of people by searching Apollo's database (presumably compiled mostly by LinkedIn scraping?). I chose to target designers, content writers and digital artists at senior level.

- It took a while to figure out the UI for how to coordinate the List and the Sequence, but once done I just took the first 100 users from the list and asked Apollo to trigger the Sequence.

- The platform has been steadily sending emails from my account ever since!
