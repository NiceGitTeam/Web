After an _...ahem..._ 'short' hiatus, I'm thrilled to announce that NiceGit is back, and with a clearer vision than ever!

<!--more-->
Over the last few years I've had the privilege of leading incredible cross-disciplinary teams across a spectrum of cutting-edge projects - from Virtual Reality experiences and mobile apps to AI image processing and sound design. This hands-on experience has been eye-opening, and it's only reinforced my conviction that we need better tools for creative collaboration.

Time and again, I've watched talented artists, designers, and creators struggle with Git, ultimately abandoning it for simple file-sharing platforms like Google Docs or Dropbox. These are brilliant, creative people who should be focusing on their craft, not fighting with version control. This challenge - making collaboration seamless for everyone - was the original spark behind [NiceGit](/), and it's even more relevant today.

The timing couldn't be better. The explosion of AI tools and the rise of cross-functional teams have transformed how we create digital products. We're seeing sound designers working alongside ML engineers, 3D artists collaborating with backend developers, and writers partnering with UI designers. These diverse teams need a platform that speaks their language and supports their workflows naturally.

So with this in mind, and with life once again allowing for the time it deserves, [NiceGit](/) is a live project again! Over the next couple of months I'll be talking to potential users and domain experts about their experiences with digital project collaboration, particularly for cross-functional teams (any team involving people other than software engineers), exploring potential business plans and seeking opportunities to get the project from a vision and a prototype, into a real startup business.

The vision has expanded dramatically, and the potential impact feels bigger than ever. Ideas and experiences from working with AI, and other intra-team problems more indirectly related to source control itself, have hugely expanded the potential scope. NiceGit was always intended to be a platform not a tool, and the possibilities opened up by having a people-first platform that also understands the workflows and files of its users, is huge. Watch this space for more over the coming months.

The goal is ambitious but clear, to build a people-first platform that understands not just your files, but your team's creative workflows and the natural ways you want to work together. The prototype is already showing promising results - in fact, I'm using it right now to write and publish this very blog post through GitHub Pages!

Anyway, there is work to do and energy levels are high, so it's time to modernise the tech stack, get the NiceGit prototype app running again, and think about what 2025 will look like...
