![Cross-disciplinary teams bridging the gap](/images/posts/two-laptops.png)

After an _...ahem..._ 'short' hiatus, I've decided to take another look at NiceGit. In the intervening time I've worked with and overseen several cross-disciplinary teams on projects including Virtual Reality, mobile app development, sound and copy design and AI image processing. Without exception, every one of those teams was either using Git for source control and having major difficulties, or had tried Git, given up and looked for simpler bespoke solutions based on platforms such as Google Docs or Dropbox.

This over-complexity of using and maintaining source control is the basic problem that was the starting point for [NiceGit](/). Many users simply want easy, everyday collaboration on digital files with their colleagues. This seemingly simple need is, surprisingly, still hugely underserved.

So with this in mind, and with life once again allowing for the time it deserves, [NiceGit](/) is a live project again! Over the next couple of months I'll be talking to potential users and domain experts about their experiences with digital project collaboration, particularly for cross-functional teams (any team involving people other than software engineers), exploring potential business plans and seeking opportunities to get the project from a vision and a prototype, into a real startup business.

Even over the last few weeks, my own vision for what NiceGit could be and the problems it could solve has expanded significantly. Ideas and experiences from working with AI, and other intra-team problems more indirectly related to source control itself, have hugely expanded the potential scope. NiceGit was always intended to be a platform not a tool, and the possibilities opened up by having a people-first platform that also understands the workflows and files of its users, is huge. Watch this space for more over the coming months.

And yes, this blog post was written and published (with a little help from GitHub Pages) using the NiceGit prototype!

Anyway, there is work to do and energy levels are high, so it's time to modernise the tech stack, get the NiceGit prototype app running again, and think about what 2025 will look like...
