## Join Us for the Event

Pitch Night is an annual showcase event where Startmate's most promising startups present their ideas to investors, mentors, and the broader startup community.

**When:** Thursday, May 8th

**Where:** Collins Street, Melbourne

[RSVP here to attend](https://lu.ma/PitchNightMelb?tk=c9u0zr) (DM me for a discount code)

## What to Expect

Pitch Night is a rapid fire series of three minute pitches. Condensing everything we've been working on into such a short time has been a challenge, but hugely energising as it's helped to focus on what's truly important, especially the potential size of the opportunity. It's also the first time I've been able to incorporate the results of the dozens of user interviews I've conducted over the last six weeks. Watch this space for more information from those interviews in our next post!

The event will also feature other innovative teams from Startmate's various programs, including the Launch Club cohort that NiceGit is currently part of. It should be a fantastic opportunity to see what's happening at the cutting edge of the Australian startup ecosystem.

It's been a while since I've publicly pitched like this, so I've been learning my lines and honing the timing. Thanks to Andy Mellor, Dave Jackson and my two sons for helping me practice and providing valuable feedback.

## See You There

If you're interested in the future of creative collaboration, version control that actually makes sense, or just want to support us on this journey, I'd be thrilled to see you at the event. Please let me know if you're attending and I'll be sure to say hi!
