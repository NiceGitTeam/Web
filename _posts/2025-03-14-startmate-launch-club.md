I'm thrilled to announce that NiceGit has been accepted into [Startmate's Launch Club](https://www.startmate.com/launch-club) pre-accelerator program! This is a huge milestone for the project and a fantastic opportunity to turn our vision for better creative collaboration into reality.

[Launch Club](https://www.startmate.com/launch-club) is Startmate's 8 week pre-accelerator program, designed to help early stage founders validate their ideas and build the foundations for successful startups. Being selected alongside other innovative founders is both exciting and humbling.

What I'm most looking forward to is diving deep into user research. While I've seen the problems NiceGit aims to solve firsthand in my work with cross-disciplinary teams, Launch Club will give me the structure and support to really understand the pain points of creative collaboration at scale. I'll be talking to teams across different industries and disciplines, from game development studios to AI research groups, learning about their workflows and challenges.

The [Startmate team](https://www.startmate.com/mentors) brings an incredible wealth of experience in helping founders navigate the early stages of company building. Their track record speaks for itself, they've helped launch some of Australia's most innovative startups. Being able to learn from their experience, especially around user research and business model validation, is an incredible opportunity.

I'm also excited about working alongside the other Launch Club founders. I've yet to see the full intake list, but have already made connections with some [very cool looking teams](https://www.heali.com/).

Over the next 8 weeks, I'll be:

- Conducting in-depth interviews with creative teams about their collaboration challenges
- Testing and validating our core assumptions about what teams need
- Refining our business model and go-to-market strategy
- Building relationships with potential early adopters

If you're part of a cross-disciplinary team working on creative projects, I'd love to chat with you about your collaboration experiences. Whether you're using Git, struggling with Git, or have given up on Git entirely, your insights would be invaluable.

Here's to the next chapter of NiceGit's journey! ðŸš€
