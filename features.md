## One-Button Sync

At it's purest, source control is a way for teams to synchronise projects so that everyone sees the same shared files. NiceGit's unique _One Button Sync_ makes this as simple as it sounds. Whenever you're ready, click the button to share your work with your team mates, and see their latest changes. Simple.

By prioritising simplicity, NiceGit handles the complexity of other source control tools behind the scenes. No more Pulling, Pushing, Fetching, Merging (or was it rebasing?), _One-Button Sync_ works just as you'd expcect it would.

## Real-time Team Updates

NiceGit's famililar feed view shows you what's happening in your team, as it happens. As soon as someone starts working on a file, or finishes working on a feature, you'll see it all.

Common problems such as duplication of work, or two people working on the same file at the same time are gone at a stroke. Whether your team is remote or in-person, you'll know who's storming through the backlog, and who might need support.

## File Locking

One of the most common issues with working on shared files is muliple people trying to change the same file at the same time. In traditional source control systems this can result in the dreaded _Merge Conflict_. Even shared drives such as Dropbox and Google Drive experience this issue. The result is lost time and lost work as someone needs to figure out how to combine everyones changes.

NiceGit solves this problem through our automated file locking system. As soon as one person starts working on a file, the rest of the team is notified and the file is 'locked', preventing them from making changes. The file is automatically unlocked as soon as it is safe to work on. Most of the time you'll never even notice it's happening!

## All the power of Git, none of the complexity

NiceGit projects are standard Git repositories. This makes it easy to work with existing projects and colleagues using traditional Git tools. If you or your team already has a Git repository, setting up NiceGit takes just a few seconds. Simply open the repository and NiceGit will do its thing!

NiceGit also works wth all of the major hosting providers, including [GitHub](https://github.com), [GitLab](https://gitlab.com) and [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org). Third-party integrations such as Pull Requests, Continuous Integration and compliance features such as Branch Protection all _just work_. If you'd like to talk to us about other hosts or features, please just [drop us a line](/contact).
